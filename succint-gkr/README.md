# Succinct GKR Protocol Implementation
This repository contains an implementation of a Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (SNARK) based on the GKR (Goldwasser-Kalai-Rothblum) protocol, enhanced with Multilinear KZG (Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg) polynomial commitments. This implementation transforms the interactive GKR protocol into a non-interactive, succinct proof system.


## Overview
This project implements a succinct version of the GKR protocol, which allows a prover to convince a verifier that a computation was performed correctly, without the verifier having to redo the entire computation. By incorporating Multilinear KZG commitments, the proof becomes succinct (small and easy to verify), making it a SNARK.

## Key Components

1. __SuccintGKRProof__: Represents the succinct proof generated by the prover.
2. __SuccintGKRProtocol__: The main structure implementing the succinct GKR protocol.
3. __Circuit__: Represents the arithmetic circuit being proven.
4. __MultilinearKZG__: Used for polynomial commitments, crucial for achieving succinctness.
5. __FiatShamirTranscript__: Implements the Fiat-Shamir heuristic for non-interactive proofs.

## Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the succinct GKR protocol:
```rs
let circuit = Circuit::new(/* ... */);
let input = vec![/* ... */];

// Set up the trusted setup
let tau = TrustedSetup::<Bls12_381>::setup(&input);

// Generate the succinct proof
let (commitment, proof) = GKRProtocol::prove(&circuit, &input, &tau);

// Verify the succinct proof
let verify = GKRProtocol::verify(&circuit, &commitment, &proof, &tau);
```
