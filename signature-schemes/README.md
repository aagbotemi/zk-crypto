# Cryptographic Signature Schemes
This repository contains implementations of cryptographic signature schemes. They are fundamental cryptographic tools used for secure messaging, data verification, and authentication.

## Features
- __Schnorr__:
    - Key generation (on elliptic curve BLS12-381)
    - Message signing and verification
    - Batch signature verification
- __RSA__:
    - Key generation (using two prime numbers)
    - Message encryption and decryption
    - Utilities for Eulerâ€™s Totient function and GCD check
